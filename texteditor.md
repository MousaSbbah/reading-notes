# A text editor
 is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, 
or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text
, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one 
of the **most important** tools you can use as an aspiring web developer

What features should you look for in a **text editor**? I would say some
of the most important features are: 
   1. code completion 
   2. syntax highlighting
   3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue) 
   4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

maybe there is some other features that are must-haveâ€™s, but I think these features are a good
start. and maybe the best text editor is **truly the one that you enjoy** using the most
