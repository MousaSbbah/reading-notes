## Loops Counters

A for loop uses a counter as a condition. Yhis instructs the code to run a specified number of times. 

The condition is made up of three statements:
   
   * **Initialization** : creat a variable This variable is commonly called `i` , and it acts as the counter
   `var i = 0 ;`
   *  **Condition** : The loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number
   `i < 10 `

   * **Update** : change the counter value 

   `i++` or `i=i+1`
