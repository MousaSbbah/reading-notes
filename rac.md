# Seeing Your Remotes

To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git remote command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified

By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
