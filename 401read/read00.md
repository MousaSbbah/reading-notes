# How to **Solve** **Programming** **Problems**

## A simple set of steps
Simple steps for any algorithm type programming problem.

* Read the problem completely twice.
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* Optimize the manual steps.
* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
* Optimize the real code.

## How to Use the 5 **Whys**

1. Assemble a Team

    Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.

2. Define the Problem


3. Ask the First "Why?"

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

5. Know When to Stop

6. Address the Root Cause(s)

7. Monitor Your Measures

## How to **think** like a programmer

Here are the steps:
1. **Understand**

    Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.
2. **Plan**

    Don’t dive right into solving without a plan. Plan your solution!

    Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

    
3. **Divide**

    Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

    Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

    After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

4. **Stuck?**
    *  **Debug**: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
    
    * **Reassess**: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

    * **Research**: Ahh, good ol’ **Google**. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).
