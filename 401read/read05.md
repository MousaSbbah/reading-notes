# Linked List

## What Is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure that contains a sequence of nodes, in which each node contains data and a pointer to another node. The most common example is a singly linked list, where each node contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next list, as shown in the diagram below.
