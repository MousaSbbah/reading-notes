## Review, Research, and Discussion


**Describe “The Cloud”**

"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

**What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. ... Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.


**What is auto-scaling?**

**What is bandwidth?**

Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).


**How do cloud providers compute service costs?**

 by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.

### **Document the following Vocabulary Terms**


|Term||
|--|--|
|Server Instances|is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.|
|Containers|a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.|
|Cloud Services|are services available via a remote cloud computing server rather than an on-site server. These scalable solutions are managed by a third party and provide users with access to computing services such as analytics or networking via the internet.|
|Cloud Architecture| is how individual technologies are integrated to create clouds—IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network.|
|AWS|Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. |

# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.

## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically and precisely allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from over 200 AWS services and SaaS applications or call it directly from any web or mobile app. You can write Lambda functions in your favorite language (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more) and use both serverless and container tools, such as AWS SAM or Docker CLI, to build, test, and deploy your functions.
