## [The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

Article Summary: A man passionate about programming and got a good job, but one day he built a website for a pharmaceutical company and he had no information about the content of the site, unfortunately, they were promoting a type of narcotic drug that has side effects that lead to depression and suicide.

I agree with the author that it is necessary to ensure the purpose of the project that any programmer is building and to make sure that it does not break any ethical standards.


## Ethics in Technology


## [Ethical dilemma of self driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)

When car companies began to invent the self-driving system, they faced a lot of questions about how to act in the random accidents that could occur during the driving period. The answers were that self-driving will take care of the largest possible number of human lives, regardless of age or gender, in addition to the priority of life. human over property 

I agree with these theories because the most important thing in the case of traffic disasters is to preserve the largest possible number of human lives, even if it is at the expense of the life of the owner of the car, and this is something that does not exist in traditional driving.
