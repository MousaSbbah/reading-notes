# Reading: React Native



## Review, Research, and Discussion


- **Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”**

     - You already have a Redux app and you want to simplify your existing data fetching logic
    - You want to be able to use the Redux DevTools to see the history of changes to your state over time
    - You want to be able to integrate the RTK Query behavior with the rest of the Redux ecosystem
    - Your app logic needs to work outside of React
        

- **What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit**

    Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.

# React Native

React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code.

# Expo 

Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
