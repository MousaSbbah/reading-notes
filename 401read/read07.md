## Review, Research, and Discussion

- **Write the following steps in the correct order:**
    - Receive access token
    - Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
    - Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
    - Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
    - Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
    - Receive authorization code
    - Make a request to the access token endpoint

    1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
    2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
    3. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
    4. Make a request to the third-party API endpoint
    5. Receive authorization code
    6. Make a request to the access token endpoint
    7. Receive access token

- **What can you do with an authorization code?**
    An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.

- **What can you do with an access token?**
     represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. 

- **What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?**
OAuth is a delegated authorization framework for REST/APIs. It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user's data without giving away a user's password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities.

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client ID**           | The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it's public, it's best that it isn't guessable by third parties                                                                                            |
| **Client Secret**      | a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. Protect your client secrets and never include them in mobile or browser-based apps.                                                                                                                 |
| **Authentication Endpoint**           | This is the endpoint that is called to obtain an access token which can then be used in the subsequent password update callouts. If no endpoint is specified a Basic Authentication header, constructed from the client-id and client-secret configuration entries, is used.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Access Token Endpoint** | The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. This section describes how to verify token requests and how to return the appropriate response and errors.                                                                                             |
| **API ENDPOINT**                |   API endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. |

# Bearer Authorization

**Definition**: Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.

## What is JSON Web Token?
![](https://devonblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jwt_05.jpg)
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## What is the JSON Web Token structure?
![](https://habrastorage.org/webt/oq/x9/6o/oqx96ozecxiq4qbsrzrk-dw7n5u.png)

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature
Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

`xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz `


## Use
JWTs can be used in various ways:

- **Authentication**: When a user successfully logs in using their credentials, an ID token is returned. According to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) specs, an ID token is always a JWT.

- **Authorization**: Once a user is successfully logged in, an application may request to access routes, services, or resources (e.g., APIs) on behalf of that user. To do so, in every request, it must pass an Access Token, which may be in the form of a JWT. Single Sign-on (SSO) widely uses JWT because of the small overhead of the format, and its ability to easily be used across different domains.

- **Information Exchange**: JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties because they can be signed, which means you can be sure that the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, the structure of a JWT allows you to verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.
