#  Growth mindest

It can be said that a growth mindset is the self-development of a person, and it is possible for anyone to reach his goal by perseverance and keeping his mind in a positive state.

In my case, to keep my growth mindset I do the following :

   1. **Reading** books
   2. Use my free time for things that keep my mind **active**, such as *strategy games*
   3. I try with all my **efforts** to reach my goal no matter how hard it takes
