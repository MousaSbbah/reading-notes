# Functional programming

Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles (listed above). Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.

## Functional programming favors:
* Pure functions instead of shared state & side effects
* Immutability over mutable data
* Function composition over imperative flow control
* Lots of generic, reusable utilities that use higher order functions to act on many data types instead of methods that only operate on their colocated data
* Declarative rather than imperative code (what to do, rather than how to do it)
* Expressions over statements
* Containers & higher order functions over ad-hoc polymorphism
