# The Call Stack and Debugging


## The Call Stack
A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

* When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
* Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
* When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
* If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

###  **Example**

```js
function greeting() {
   // [1] Some code here
   sayHi();
   // [2] Some code here
}
function sayHi() {
   return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some code here

``` 

## What causes a stack overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accommodate before throwing a stack error.

Here is an example:
```js
function callMyself(){
  callMyself();
}

callMyself();

```
