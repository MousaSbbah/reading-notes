# Introduction 

JavaScript allows you to make pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while its being viewed in the browser 

Sooo how java script makes we pages more interactive ??

### 1. Access content 
You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page.

### 2. MODIFY CONTENT 

You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them

### 3. PROGRAM RULES 
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page

### 4. REACT TO EVENTS 
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred

***
## WRITING A SCRIPT 

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

**Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps.** 

  1. DEFINE THE GOAL 
  2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
  3. CODE EACH STEP

  # OPERATORS 
  Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

 # EXPRESSIONS
 An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions: 

   1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE  

        `var color = 'beige';`
    
   2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE

         ` var area = 3 * 2; `



***
# FUNCTIONS

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

 

 FOR EXAMPLE:: 

 ***
to **creat function** we use this format :

      function sayhi() {

     consol.log('Hi')
    } 

 and to **call** this function :

      sayhi()
